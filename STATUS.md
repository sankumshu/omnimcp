- [ ] Server routes have stub implementations
- [ ] No tests written yet
- [ ] No CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No production deployment config

### Missing Features
- [ ] Actual MCP server process spawning (platform-hosted)
- [ ] Webhook signature verification
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Usage quota enforcement
- [ ] Billing integration
- [ ] Email notifications

### Documentation Gaps

## üí° Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Hosting Model | Hybrid (platform + developer) | Flexibility + scalability |
| Dashboard Approach | Phased (Config ‚Üí Visual Builder) | Fast MVP, then differentiation |
| Marketplace Pricing | Free MCPs | Lower friction, build network effects |
| SDK License | MIT (open source) | Encourage adoption |
| Platform License | Proprietary | Protect business model |
| Tech Stack | Node.js + PostgreSQL + Next.js | Fast development, scalable |
